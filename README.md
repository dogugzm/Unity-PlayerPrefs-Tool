## Overview
The Generic PlayerPref Scanner is a Unity Editor tool designed to streamline the process of managing PlayerPrefs in Unity projects. With this tool, developers can easily scan their project's scripts to identify and manage PlayerPrefs usage. It provides a user-friendly interface for scanning, viewing, and selectively deleting PlayerPrefs entries across scripts.

## Features
- **Efficient Scanning**: Quickly scan all scripts within your Unity project to identify PlayerPrefs usage.
- **Partial Deletion**: Easily delete PlayerPrefs entries selectively instead of clearing all PlayerPrefs at once.
- **Script-Based Organization**: View PlayerPrefs entries categorized by the scripts where they are set.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: User-friendly interface for scanning and managing PlayerPrefs.
- **Unity Editor Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into the Unity Editor for ease of use.

## Partial Deletion Feature
The Partial Deletion feature allows developers to selectively delete PlayerPrefs entries, providing more granular control over PlayerPrefs management. This feature is particularly useful when developers want to remove specific PlayerPrefs without affecting others.

To utilize the Partial Deletion feature:

- Scan your project using the "Scan All Player Prefs" button.
- Review the PlayerPrefs entries categorized by script.
- Click on individual PlayerPrefs entries to delete them.
- Deleted PlayerPrefs entries will be removed from the respective script's PlayerPrefs list.
